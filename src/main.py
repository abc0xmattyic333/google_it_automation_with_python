# Create a print statement that displays the output hello world

# Print "Hello, World!" to the console

# print("Hello, World!<3")

# Output: Hello, World!<3
# The above code prints "Hello, World!<3" to the console.

# Output: Buy me a coffee: 0xb26DDe29cF72F37A64aF8B292209B6FEe686A3B6

# Calculate the number of minutes in a 24-hour day
# A day has 24 hours, and each hour has 60 minutes.
# To find the total number of minutes in a day, we multiply 24 by 60.
# The result is 1440 minutes.
# print(24 * 60)
# Output: 1440

# Calculate the number of minutes in a 24-hour day
minutes_per_hour = 60
hours_per_day = 24
minutes_per_day = minutes_per_hour * hours_per_day

print("The number of minutes in a 24-hour day is:", minutes_per_day)

# Distances in miles
distance_to_market = 6
distance_to_school = 2

# Calculate the difference
difference = distance_to_market - distance_to_school

# Output the result

# In a managed computing environment, there are 200 remote computers that must download 200 MB (megabytes) of updates each month. 
# There are 1024 KB (kilobytes) in each MB.
# Fill in the blank in the code below to compute the number of total kilobytes downloaded by all computers from the remote update server each month. 
# Multiply the total number of computers by the download size in KB to calculate. 

download_size_kb = 200*1024
total_computers = 200
total_kbs = total_computers * download_size_kb

print(total_kbs) # Should print 40960000.0

# Output: 40960000.0
