# Review: Use Jupyterlabs and Jupyter Notebooks

There are many different places and environments that you can use to write and run code. 

The nice thing about Vs Code it allows us to create .ipynb files.

To structure our code I have created a src folder.

We can create .ipynb files and also .py files, I have created basic hello_world examples and placed them within our src folder.

Now if we check from the command-line if those exist, we can easily do so.

You will also find a Jupyterlabs Python example. Which if you don't feel like using Vs Code you can try out [Jupyterlabs](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) in your browser.

Nicely done! :)

We installed Jupyterlabs by typing this into our termnial.
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

We installed Jupyter Notebooks by typing this into our termnial.
```
pip install jupyter notebook
```
