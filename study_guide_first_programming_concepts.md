# Study Guide: First Programming Concepts

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of hat you learned on this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.

## Functions

A function is a piece of code that performs a uint of work. In the examples  you've seen so far, you have only encountered the print() function, which outputs a messsage to the screen. You will use this function frequently in this course to check the results oof your code. The syntzx of the print() function is modeled in the example below.

```
# Syntax for printing a string of text. 

print("Hello, world!")
```

## Keywords
A keyword is a reserved word in a programming language that performs a specific purpose. In your first Python example, you briefly hencountered the keywords for and in. Note that keywords will often apper in bold in this course.

In the next few weeks, you will also learn the following keywords:

Values: True, False, None
Conditions: if, elif, else
Logical operators: and, or, not
Loops: for, in, while, break, continue
Functions: def, return

## Arithmetic operators
Python can calculate numbers using common mathematical operators, along with some special operators, too:

- x+y - Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y.
- x-y - Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y.
- x*y - Multiplication * operator returns the product x times y 
- x/y - Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y.
- x**y - Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of y.
- x**2 - Square expression returns x squared.
- x**3 - Cube expression returns x cubed.
- x**(1/2) - Square root(1/2) or (.05) fraction exponent operator returns the square roof of x.
- x // y - Floor divison operator returns the interger part of the integer division of x by y.
- x%y - Modulo operators returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y.

### Order of Operations
The order of operations are to be calculated from left-to-right in the following order:

- 1. Parentheses(),{}.[]
- 2. Exponents xy   (x**y)
- 3. Multiplication * and Division /
- 4. Addition + and Subtraction

You might find the PEMDAS mnemonic device to be helpful in remembering order.
